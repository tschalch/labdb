                           Installation of labdb

  System requirements
  -------------------

  Your system needs to provide a web server with PHP version 5 or higher, and
  access to a MYSQL database. An installation of PhpMyAdmin is recommended for
  manipulating the database directly.

  Security precautions
  --------------------

  Since labdb has been developed for a closed environment, it should NOT be
  installed in a location that is accessible from the World Wide Web or in any
  other environment where malicous attacks are likely.

  Installation procedure
  ----------------------

  Get the entire labdb distribution from https://github.com/tschalch/labdb using
  checkout with git or by downloading the zip file. 

  From the distribution, copy the "html" directory tree to your document root
  and rename it to labdb. Use PhpMyAdmin to create a new database called "labdb"
  with collation "utf8_unicode_ci". Import the file "labdbMin.sql" into the new
  database. Add a new user called "labdb" to you MYSQL database and give it full
  privileges to the labdb database.

  Now edit the config.php in the labdb web directory to reflect your setup.
  
  This is it. The database is now accessible under the directory it was
  installed on the webserver, and the default user is "admin" with password
  "admin". Change the password on your first login by going to "Your Profile".
