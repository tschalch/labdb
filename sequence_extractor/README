Installing Sequence Extractor
-----------------------------
Paul Stothard, stothard@ualberta.ca

This guide assumes that you have the Apache web server installed and
that you are familiar with its configuration. 

0. The sequence extractor web pages are in the 'html' directory, and
the Perl scripts are in the 'cgi-bin' directory.

1. Make sure Apache can follow symbolic links from its cgi-bin and
htdocs directory by checking the httpd.conf file. The configuration
should look something like this:

<Directory "/usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride All
    Options FollowSymLinks
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

<Directory "/usr/local/apache2/htdocs">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

2. Create symbolic links in the Apache cgi-bin directory and the
Apache htdocs directory to the sequence extractor 'html' and 'cgi-bin'
directories:

cd to htdocs and then use something like:
ln -s /home/paul/paul_dev/perl/sequence_extractor_2006/html/ seqext

cd to cgi-bin and then use:
ln -s /home/paul/paul_dev/perl/sequence_extractor_2006/cgi-bin/ seq_ext

3. Edit the Sequence Extractor index.html file to set the correct path
to the cgi-bin script. The line to change is:

<form method="post" action="http://localhost/cgi-bin/seq_ext/se.pl">

For example, for the Bioinformatics.org mirror this line is:

<form method="post" action="http://www.bioinformatics.org/paul/cgi-bin/se.pl">

4. Edit the make_output.pm file to change the URL for the overlib.js
library. The line to edit is:

print "<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://localhost/seqext/includes/overlib.js\"><!-- overLIB (c) Erik Bosrup --></script>\n";

For example, for the Bioinformatics.org mirror this line is:

print "<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://bioinformatics.org/seqext/includes/overlib.js\"><!-- overLIB (c) Erik Bosrup --></script>\n";
