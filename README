  Version 0.1

  What is it?
  -----------

  Labdb is an web based database for a molecular biology laboratory. I have
  written this software for use in the Leemor Joshua-Tor lab at Cold Spring
  Harbor Laboratory and it has been in use there for the last 4 years. I am not
  a professional programmer, and the code is rather rough, but it works.
  labdb has not been widely tested and will require some knowledge of php
  and mysql from the administrator. I aim to maintain and possible further
  develop this system for future use and for implementation in other
  laboratories.

  Features
  --------

  * Ordering and inventory system for chemicals, supplies and consumables. 
  * Cloning and DNA construct design database.
  * Log book function.
