  Version 0.1

  What is it?
  -----------

  Labdb is an web based database for a molecular biology laboratory. I have
  written this software for use in my laboratory and it has been in use for
  many years. I am not a professional programmer, and the code is rather rough,
  but it works.  labdb has not been widely tested and will require some
  knowledge of php and mysql from the administrator.

  Features
  --------

  * Ordering and inventory system for chemicals, supplies and consumables. 
  * Cloning and DNA construct design database.
  * Freezer stock management.
  * Resource booking system.
  * Log book function.
